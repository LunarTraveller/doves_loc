 building_yuranic_crystal_forge_desc:0 "对于有审美倾向的人来说，育兰水晶锻造厂从远处看来就如同一个奇观——水晶的散射反光让整个建筑在黑暗中如同一座小钻石山一般闪闪发光，因此需要额外的安全措施和传感器保护。"
 tech_mine_neutronium_mastery:0 "突破：零素锻造厂进度"
 tech_mine_neutronium_mastery_desc:0 "\"Mining\" Neutronium 'Ore' is a bit of an oxymoron. Neutronium is, in fact, a form of liquid that has properties similar to plasma - and is incredibly difficult to extract due to the fact that once even ten percentage of the gravitational pressure involved is loosened, it expands. Rapidly. And very, very violently. Once it IS extracted, however, the issue became simply ... what to do with it.\n\nWhile it's often stated it can be forged into armor, the reality is that what is actually done is that the Neutronium 'ore' is utilized in a process that allows the creation of new hyper-density alloys and materials; not quite Neutronium proper, but definitely close (a micron-thick layer of actual Neutronium across the hull of a Corvette would outstrip the mass of an entire continent) and layering it into pre-existing composites.\n\nWhile we have had some success thus far, we could theoretically refine the process even further - though it would require a facility the size of a small nation, the results would be far, far more potent armor technology and also potentially using Neutronium itself as an extreme-yield explosive."
 building_neutronium_macro_forge:0 "Neutronium Macro-Forge"
 building_neutronium_macro_forge_desc:0 "Considered extremely dangerous to operate in - for obvious reasons - most operations in the Macro-Forge are done either via tele-operation or with super-heavy suits, as the sheer radiation and energy involved in the forge (in addition to wanting to keep impurities away) means it is better to try and keep clear. It is also the reason why the Forge is located far away from any settlements - even a very tiny error in the containment fields equate a very, very, very large explosion."

 tech_mine_dark_matter_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Dark Matter Containment"
 tech_mine_dark_matter_mastery_desc:0 "Dark Matter was for a very, very long time believed to be the single dominant force of matter in the universe - but still vastly eclipsed by Dark Energy. New research into Dark Matter - and the ability to draw it from small, local ultra-high density pockets - has resulted in that theoretically, it could be long-term contained in special facilities. While the full set of details will require special authorization and sanction, in particular for setting up these facilities and allocating the necessary materials, crews, engineers, scientists, shield arrays, bunkers, emergency facilities, non-listed armies and orbital macro-weapons for containment, the gain is significant."

 building_satramene_gas_refinery_desc:0 "This facility - located away from settlements - imports large quantities of Satramene gas for refinement into their liquid form, which has many uses in many fields throughout our empire. Unfortunately, security has to be tripled on a regular basis to the point the facility looks like a fortress, due to the fact that the gas is incredibly valuable."
 tech_mine_garanthium_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Garanthium Engineering"
 tech_mine_garanthium_mastery_desc:1 "The use of Garanthium in starship construction is fairly obvious - it is malleable, it is durable and generally speaking renders most composites far superior when layered with it. However, using it in starships isn't the only thing we can do with Garanthium in practice; refining the material and processing it into new composites, it can be added to a massive range of construction materials and armor - from ships to buildings and smaller yet - though it has the drawback of requiring large quantities of Garanthium."

 building_garanthium_fabricator_forge_desc:0 "The Garanthium Fabricator Forge constantly produces and recycles Garanthium composite materials which are sent and received from throughout our empire, allowing more starships, armies and planetary structures to be reinforced with the material."
 tech_mine_orillium_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Orillium Explosive Composites"
 tech_mine_orillium_mastery_desc:1 "Orillium Ore is an impressive - if notoriously unstable - mineral; its biggest and most valued trait being quite simply that it makes an absolutely incredible shield emitter material when stabilized, allowing Shield Emitters to be pushed to three, four or even five times their normal capacity without issue. Pursuing a way to mass-produce a significantly more stabilized Orillium is strategically valuable."
 building_orillium_blast_forge:0 "Orillium Blast Forge"
 building_orillium_blast_forge_desc:0 "The name is quite intentional, for the record. This complex is located far from any settlements or other key facilities, as a non-contained, ultra-refined pack of Orillium Ore not meta-stabilized into their final forms equate an unstable explosive material so powerful that replacements have to be regular. Reinforced Blast Protection is strongly recommended."
 tech_mine_living_metal_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Living Alloy Engineering"
 tech_mine_living_metal_mastery_desc:0 "Living Metals - or rather, Semi-Organic Meta-Alloy-Composites as is their full name - are strange composites of metals and various other elements, which are arranged into structures that are as resilient as actual alloys, yet possess a 'memory' capacity that means they will always try to revert to their original 'forged' state.\n\nBy understanding how this process occurs, it is possible to - in a limited way - mimic the process, allowing the creation of structures, armors and craft which can 'heal' themselves to a limited extent over time, counter-acting entropy to a degree. This has resulted in new, stronger and significantly more durable material composites, which require virtually no maintenance and can last for thousands of years - even much, much, much longer if the calculations are correct. Though, it may take a while to determine if they will truly outlast the entire universe."
 building_living_metal_refinery:0 "Living Metal Refinery"
 building_living_metal_refinery_desc:0 "The Living Metal Refinery is one of the rarest buildings in our empire, and guarded by some of the most advanced technology and systems we can provide it.

 tech_engos_vapor_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Engos Refinement"
 tech_engos_vapor_mastery_desc:3 "Engos Vapor is - aside the very effective and unusual results as a stimulant - a highly effective form of energy conductor.

 building_engos_fuel_refinery:0 "恩吉欧燃料精炼厂"
 building_engos_fuel_refinery_desc:0 "This massive refinery produces a semi-liquid form of the Engos Vapor for a large number of uses throughout our empire - its use in energy weapons, energy conductive systems and gene-modifications on every level means that production is always running at high capacity to meet demand."

 building_pitharan_dust_refinery_desc:0 "The golden streams of near-liquid Pitharan Dust equates large boosts of crop yields throughout our empire, originating from this facility. The region around it has been noted to be unusually fertile - often to such a point that it is far more work removing the greatly increased vegetation than running production of the facility."
 tech_mine_zro_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Zro Refinement"
 tech_mine_zro_mastery_desc:3 "Refining Zro into a usable form is fairly easy - however, theoretically, it can be greatly enhanced so much further yet through experimental refinement techniques and the use of advanced technology; the end result a form of Liquid Zro so potent and long-lasting that comparing it to the older, less refined form isn't even realistic. However, refinement takes a long time and as such, it will require a dedicated facility with superior security."
