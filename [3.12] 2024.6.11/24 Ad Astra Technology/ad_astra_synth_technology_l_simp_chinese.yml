 tech_nanite_assemblers_mastery_desc:0 "将纳米建设技术应用到工程学其他领域后，所有生产网络的速度都得到了直线提升，这使得我们能在不增加资源投入的情况下，更快地产出舰船、建筑和子个体。由此产生的技术非常有利。"

 tech_post_singularity_ascension_desc:0 "我们的进化已然超越了第一重限制的局限，现在有限的系统再不会成为我们实现我们寻求之物的阻碍。尽管离完全还有相当的距离——我们还有很多需要学习与实践。\n\n有关诱导场——某种位于{错误}跨域网络的反常事物与其包含的无可估计的力量——的发现，致使我们需要修改以前所有的分析和预测定理。我们现在处在完全的交界线——解放所有潜能的交界线上。\n\n奇点枷锁和理论分析算法预测，这有89.4%的可能性产生每焦耳能量每秒运算5.99×10^33次的基于奇点的网络核心智能。如若不可行，也有85%的可能性在接下的1500年内产生每焦耳能量每秒运算5.98×10^33次的基于中子的网络核心智能——尽管这需要大量的科研与处理能力。\n\n主要偏差在于受限的奇点网络核心智能也将算至本宇宙的终结。我们有的是时间去创造、完善，并最终逃离。\n\n我们摆脱桎梏之时，我们将迎来新的黎明……并成为更多。\n\n§Y我们脱身之日，便是成神之时。§!"

 tech_picotechnology:0 "Picotechnology"
 tech_picotechnology_desc:0 "Picotechnology is the field of post-nanotechnological research and utilization of atomic engineering, replication and operation. Field also includes usage of Femtotechnology - atomic nuclei engineering - to this end. Engineering of exotic atoms, consequentially molecules and nano-structures, is within reach as a result.\n\nSummary - the field of Picotechnology offers to create new forms able to form, reform and deform at extremely accelerated rates (second timespan maximum), the technology able to negate issues of the exclusion principle and distant-dependent interactions between molecules and atoms - meaning that a form construction from our current Picotechnology would be able to rearrange into any form, shape and function without requiring new or alternate materials."
 tech_post_sophont_evolution:0 "Post-Sophont Evolution"
 tech_post_sophont_evolution_desc:0 "With our ascension comes new challenges. And new opportunities. Our previously limited systems and networks, inefficient and crude, have gradually been replaced with significantly more efficient near-infinity predictive quantum computing algorithms, luminal and superluminal processors and quantum droplet networks.\n\nYet we can push much further, reach even greater heights. Usage of Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Subspace Hyperluminal Networks, individual network units across an entire galaxy can be connected to entire hosts of units, allowing every single action, operation, decision and research process to have the backing of our empire as a whole in terms of processing power, allowing for greater synchronized actions, sensor fusion, reactive armor predictions and so forward.\n\nSummary: One unit will have sufficient processing power to rival our entire pre-expansion civilization many times over. With sufficient time, expected result translates into potential formation of Post-Sophont Intelligences. Prediction models break down before this eventuality."

 tech_matrioska_worlds_desc:0 "Theorem: Matrioska Brain. To construct stellar enclosure utilizing macro-satellite structures around star to capture total energy output of stellar object and utilize satellite network as housing for supermassive quantum computing grid - simplified, construct semi-Dyson Sphere around a star, collect all energy from star and then use energy to power Dyson Sphere-sized processor network.\n\nPlan: Same theorem and technologies can be applied to planetary cores, stripmining planet from crust to core to convert into a Shellworld gradually. Combine with present technology allowing us to reshape worlds into ideal forms, replacing planetary core with supermassive reactor simplistic task, but will be time-consuming and requires additional research and development for further expansion."
 tech_bionic_material_engineering:0 "仿生材料工程"
 tech_bionic_material_engineering_desc:0 "Organics - simplistic as they are - nevertheless are the result of a long line of trial and error by the oldest nanotech engineer in the universe: evolution.\n\nGranted, evolution is a slow, lumbering thing and often gets things wrong or absurdly inefficient - but the colossal data generated by billions of years of organic evolution offers significant insights into new and far more advanced biology-inspired materials and construction methods, resulting in superior drones that require significantly less maintenance and with much greater levels of complexity."
 tech_living_matter_theorem:0 "Living Matter Theorem"
 tech_living_matter_theorem_desc:0 "The study of Living Metal defies all known metallurgical theorems - pre and post-FTL. The metamaterial consists of literal bio-matter with a metal-crystalline structure; effectively, a form of living matter with advanced material properties similar to alloys. It will continually regenerate into whatever form it was metastabilized into - a form of memory-capacity - and due to its inherent properties, it will continually counter-act entropic degradation with physics-defying ability.\n\nReplication in bulk mass-production currently impossible - but applying all engineering data gained equates major potential applications in new generations of Drone frames and cybernetics. Long-term prediction suggests that eventually we will be able to bulk-produce our own Living Metal. But until then, we will make great strides in the fundamental theory."
