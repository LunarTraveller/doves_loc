 tech_planetary_forum_normal:0 "巨型枢纽"
 tech_planetary_forum_normal_desc:0 "超级通信论坛为我们提供了许多新的可能，但随着通信量增加，帝国亟待满足的需求也在增加。同时，经济定理表明，星球上有一个大型项目作为社会经济结构中心，实际也是满足人民需要的大型枢纽，可以提供重要的政治、经济和社会机遇。"
 building_planetary_forum_normal:0 "行星论坛"
 building_planetary_forum_normal_desc:0 "行星论坛是一座巨大的综合体，说是一座特大城市也不为过。而这里正是能满足我们一切需求与欲壑的渴望之地。 应有尽有的游乐园、赌博会所、全息设施、虚拟格斗场、供祈祷和冥想的巨大神殿、艺术装置、博物馆、图书馆、演讲厅、阅兵场、赛道等等，所有场所都经过精心设计和调整，在最大限度提高效率、增强效果的同时，保证不会相互产生负面影响。\n\n不论需要什么，论坛无所不有。"
 tech_planetary_forum_hive:0 "巨型行星蜂巢"
 tech_planetary_forum_hive_desc:0 "It has been a long time since we first ascended to the stars. With each step, each new world, new challenges, new opportunities, new threats. As we expand, however, the Hive Mind's power becomes more problematic - while we exert the level of control we require to remain coherent, we lack the level of control we can require to become truly optimal. An idea has formed that might solve the issue."
 building_planetary_hive_core:0 "行星蜂巢核心"
 building_planetary_hive_core_desc:0 "The great Hive Core is a gigantic complex the size of a megacity. Bristling with specialized facilities and signal amplifiers, it is the single strongest link to the Hive Mind across the entirety of the planet - even the central administrative heart of the colony does not have the sheer potent link that it does.\n\nFrom here, specialized Drones act as a support for the Hive Mind, amplifying the link to and from, resulting in stronger, more coherent and efficient drones that move with an ease in their tasks that other worlds would struggle to achieve."
 tech_bastions_of_faith:0 "Bastions of Faith"
 tech_bastions_of_faith_desc:0 "In the many years since we first arose to the stars, we have come to learn much about the universe at large - ever faithful, we have found wonder and terror in equal measure. Now, however, our empire has come to grow to such a size and to such power, that we can and should arise to the occasion - to build monuments that will stand till the end of time itself; quiet testaments to our faith and our empire."
 building_temple_city:0 "Temple City"
 building_temple_city_desc:0 "The Grand Temple City is a colossal complex solely to our faith and to the might of our people. The size of an entire planetary nation, the city holds shrines as large as mountains, libraries of sacred texts so vast they may qualify as their own regions and shrines to glorious in stature that they pale mere art.\n\nWhile indeed enormous - a bit excessive, even one could possibly argue - the reality is that the Temple City is just that; a city in itself, with many comforts for all of faith seeking refuge.\n\nMore still, communication links back to the homeworld and to the many other Temple Cities scattered throughout the galaxy allow for vast and synchronized sermons, studies and communions of previously unheard of scale, bonding our empire together under the light of faith."
